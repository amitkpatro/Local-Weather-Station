# 🌦️ IoT Weather Station with ESP32, Adafruit IO, and Flutter

An IoT-enabled weather station that uses an ESP32 microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor to monitor real-time temperature and humidity. The data is uploaded to Adafruit IO, and a custom-built Flutter app allows users to visualize the data on their mobile devices.

# 🚀 Features
•	Real-Time Monitoring: Measure temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor.
•	Cloud Integration: Data is transmitted to Adafruit IO for cloud storage and visualization.
•	Flutter Mobile App: Displays real-time and historical data with an intuitive interface.
•	ESP32 Connectivity: Reliable Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller for seamless communication.
•	Open-Source: Fully customizable and extensible for additional features.
